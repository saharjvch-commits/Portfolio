# Test Case Prioritization & Revised Test Execution Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete QA workflow where test cases were designed,
initial test execution was planned, test case prioritization techniques were applied,
and the test execution order was revised based on priority.

This simulates a real-world testing scenario where time and risk drive execution decisions.

## 🔄 QA Workflow Followed

### Step 1: Test Case Development
- Test cases were designed using functional requirements


### Step 2: Initial Test Execution Plan
- Test cases were arranged in an initial execution order
- No prioritization was applied at this stage

### Step 3: Test Case Prioritization
Test cases were prioritized using:
1. Risk-Based Prioritization
2. Coverage-Based Prioritization
3. Requirement-Based Prioritization

### Step 4: Revised Test Execution
- Final execution order was updated based on the highest priority
- Critical test cases were executed first

---

## ✅ Outcome
- High-risk and critical test cases executed early
- Improved defect detection effectiveness
- Optimized testing effort under time constraints

---

## 📈 Key Learnings
- Importance of test case prioritization in regression cycles
- How prioritization impacts execution strategy
- Practical application of ISTQB concepts
