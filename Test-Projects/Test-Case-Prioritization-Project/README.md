# Test Case Prioritization & Revised Test Execution Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete QA workflow for a **School Management System**, where:
- Test cases were designed and organized into test suites
- An initial test execution schedule was prepared
- **Coverage-based test case prioritization** was applied
- Test execution order was **revised considering coverage and module dependencies**

This simulates a real-world QA scenario where **time constraints, coverage, and dependencies** drive execution decisions.

## 🔄 QA Workflow Followed

### Step 1: Test Case Development
- Test cases were created based on functional requirements  
- Test cases were grouped into logical test suites per module  

### Step 2: Initial Test Execution Schedule
- Test suites were scheduled in a sequential order  
- No prioritization was applied at this stage  

### Step 3: Test Case Prioritization (Coverage-Based)
- Test cases were prioritized based on **coverage percentage**  
- Test cases achieving higher coverage were planned for earlier execution  
- Authentication was identified as a **mandatory dependency** for all other modules  

### Step 4: Revised Test Execution Schedule
- Authentication test suite executed first due to dependency  
- Remaining test suites reordered based on coverage impact  
- Execution plan updated to reflect optimized testing strategy  

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Early validation of critical system access (Authentication)  
- Higher coverage achieved in early test cycles  
- Optimized execution order under limited time  
- Improved confidence in system stability

## 📈 Key Learnings
- Importance of coverage-based prioritization in test execution  
- Handling module dependencies during planning  
- Practical application of **ISTQB test prioritization concepts**  
- How prioritization improves testing effectiveness in real projects
